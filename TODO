Things To Do
$Id$

* More portability

I only use tpop3d on Linux, but would be interested in getting it running
elsewhere. This is likely to happen only on a case-by-case basis, since I
don't have access to that many machines to play with and my time is limited.

Also, there are some deficiencies in the way that locking happens on Solaris
at the moment. In particular, the c-client locking needs to use fcntl locks
on that platform. This should be easy to implement.

* More authentication schemes

Virtual-domain schemes which use /etc/passwd-style flat text files seem to be
popular, but I do not make use of anything like this. However, it would be
relatively easy to implement such a thing.

* A proper code audit

tpop3d is, as far as I know, free of obvious security deficiencies. I do not
believe that it contains any buffer overruns, and it does not make use of
temporary files, so is unlikely to suffer from /tmp race conditions. I have
thought about denial-of-service attacks, and I think that it is safe from the
most obvious ones.

Nevertheless, a full security audit would be nice....
