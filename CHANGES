Changes for tpop3d
$Id$

1.2.3

Made logging clearer; fixed a potential problem with lock files for
non-existent (empty) mail spools, and another which might lead to zombie
processes being generated under very high load. In addition, tpop3d now
checks the configuration file for the presence of unknown directives, and uses
getopt(3) for option processing, making it more like other Unix programs.

1.2.2

Minor changes; addition of a -DNO_SNIDE_COMMENTS compile-time option to please
Mark, whose user community complained about "You can hang around all day if
you like, I have better things to do".

1.2.1

Various fixes; added a patch for crypt(3) passwords in auth_mysql, and added
an option to suppress c-client metadata. CHANGES file created.
