Introduction

tpop3d is yet-another-pop3-server. The intention has been to write a
server which is fast, extensible, and secure. `Extensible' is used
specifically in the context of new authentication mechanisms and mailbox
formats. Presently the distribution supports the following authentication
mechanisms:

    auth_pam       uses Pluggable Authentication Modules
    auth_passwd         /etc/passwd (and optionally /etc/shadow)

    auth_mysql          a vmail-sql style MySQL database; see
                            http://www.ex-parrot.com/~chris/vmail-sql/
    auth_other          an external program

The latter two options provide virtual domain support; the first two are
designed to authenticate local (Unix) users.

The following mailbox formats are supported:

    bsd             for BSD (`Unix') mailspools
    maildir             Qmail-style maildirs
    empty               null driver


Usage instructions

Have a look at the man page, tpop3d.8.


Installation

Have a look at the file INSTALL in the distribution. tpop3d uses gnu autoconf,
so it should be reasonably simple to make it work.


Modifying and extending tpop3d

Have a look at the file HACKING in the distribution. tpop3d is fairly well
commented and a number of people have been able to make useful modifications.


Mailing list

tpop3d now has a mailing list, tpop3d-discuss@lists.beasts.org. This is a
low-traffic mailing list which will also be used for announcements of new
tpop3d revisions. To subscribe, send an email with the subject `subscribe' to
tpop3d-discuss-request@lists.beasts.org.
