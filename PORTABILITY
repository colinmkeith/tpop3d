Portability notes for tpop3d
$Id$

I wrote tpop3d on Linux, and that is the platform on which it has been tested
most thoroughly. However, if you want to build it on another platform, please
go right ahead. You may need to make some tweaks (mostly in the Makefile,
hopefully). Here is what I know about compiling tpop3d on other platforms, so
far:

* FreeBSD (and probably other modern BSD systems)

  You will need to comment out the line which enables flock(2) locking, since
  FreeBSD implements this with fcntl(2) locking; attempting to use both
  therefore causes tpop3d to deadlock.

  You will need to remove the reference to -ldl, which does not exist on
  FreeBSD (on Linux it is needed to link against PAM with dynamic libraries
  support).

  You will probably want to change the definition oF MAILSPOOL_DIR to be
  "/var/mail".

* Others

  You tell me....
