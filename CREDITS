Credits and contributors for tpop3d
$Id$

Paul Warren-- for pointing out that gnu-pop3d sucked, and that we needed
something better.

Mark Longair-- for testing, patches, bug fixes and the odd (metaphorical)
kick in the teeth when I'd done something dense and he'd acted as the victim.

Dom Gallagher-- for help testing tpop3d on Solaris, and for contributing
crypt(3)-style authentication for auth_mysql.

And numerous others, for putting up with foolish questions about Unix
mailspool handling or (more often) indignant rants about Unix in general and
the sorry state of mail locking in particular.
