Credits and contributors for tpop3d
$Id$

Paul Warren-- for pointing out that gnu-pop3d sucked, and that we needed
something better.

Mark Longair-- for contributing autoconf/automake support and becoming tpop3d's
mentor in the Cult of Debian; also for testing, patches, bug fixes and the odd
(metaphorical) kick in the teeth when I'd done something dense and he'd acted
as the victim.

Dom Gallagher-- for help testing tpop3d on Solaris, and for contributing
crypt(3)-style authentication for auth_mysql.

Roberto Braga-- for a reliability patch to the example init.d script.

Paul Makepeace-- for contributing maildir support, and getting tpop3d running
on Mac OS X.

Allan Joergensen-- for helping me find and fix a bug with the code which was
causing problems on Linux for S/390.

Mike Bremford-- for contributing the SQL templating code for auth-mysql.

Sebastien Thomas-- for contributing auth-ldap.

Ben Schumacher-- for bug fixes and useful commentary.

Jason Clifford-- for an enhancement of the PAM code.

Matthew Reimer-- for the $(serverhost) patch.

Michael Klatsky and Marc Lewis-- for helping to fix bugs in the LDAP code.

Angel Marin-- for the auth-flatfile authenticator.

Arkadiusz Miskiewicz-- for WHOSON protocol support.

And numerous others, for putting up with foolish questions about Unix
mailspool handling or (more often) indignant rants about Unix in general and
the sorry state of file locking in particular.
